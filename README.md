Currently have a requirements.txt based off of my notebook environment but its possible theres a bit too much stuff in there atm...

npm install for the frontend (after u cd into frontend folder).

Be sure to mainly work on dev branch and to make sure everything works well before pull request. I don't have any permissions for the pull request or anything so you can just do it whenever.

You can also make your own branch if you'd like. Up to you.
