# 6242app

Currently have a requirements.txt based off of my notebook environment but its possible theres a bit too much stuff in there atm...

pip install -r requirements.txt for the model.

npm install for the frontend (after u cd into frontend folder).

Be sure to mainly work on dev branch and to make sure everything works well before pull request. I don't have any permissions for the pull request or anything so you can just do it whenever.

You can also make your own branch if you'd like. Up to you.

----------------
Under model stuff,

Notebookdata1 was what I doing, trying to accrue songs and using spotify and musixmatch api

Notebookdata2 was what I used to create the new csv with the 5 million song dataset.

Notebookdata3 will be what we'll use to create our training / testing set comparing the embeddings of lyrics and books and what not.
